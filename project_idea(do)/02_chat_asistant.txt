Project 2 – AI Study Buddy (Rule-Based Chat
Assistant in Python)

Objective
To create a conversational AI assistant using Python’s core logic - string
matching, functions, dictionaries, and loops.

Concepts Used

Concept Purpose

Strings To analyze and compare user input

Conditionals
(if-elif-else)

To decide chatbot responses

Dictionaries To store questions and responses

Functions To organize chatbot logic

Loops To keep the chat running

User Input
(input())

To take input from the user

Description

In this project, we will build a mini AI chatbot that can interact with users.
The chatbot will understand simple messages like “hello,” “motivate me,” or
“python” and respond with friendly, intelligent answers.
This is a rule-based chatbot, it doesn’t use real AI models yet, but it behaves
intelligently using Python logic.

Sample Output
🤖 Hello! I am Saumya’s Study Buddy!
You can talk to me. Type 'bye' anytime to exit.

You: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

You: Who are you?
Bot: I’m your friendly AI Study Buddy created by Saumya Singh.

You: Motivate me
Bot: Keep going! Every bug you fix makes you a better coder 💪

You: Tell me about Python
Bot: Python is powerful — it can do AI, automation, and much more!

You: Bye
Bot: Goodbye! Keep learning and keep smiling 😊

Features
● Responds to simple user inputs
● Works continuously until the user types bye
● Easy to customize with new keywords and responses
● Demonstrates real-world chatbot logic using Python fundamentals

Future Scope

1. Add time-based greetings (using datetime module)
2. Add text-to-speech (using pyttsx3)
3. Add voice input (using speech_recognition)
4. Connect to an AI API for real answers (like OpenAI / Hugging Face)
5. Store chat history in a file using File Handling

📜 Showcase as Minor Project
Project Title: AI Study Buddy – Rule-Based Chat Assistant in Python

Objective: To create a conversational assistant using Python’s core logic -
string matching, functions, dictionaries, and loops.
Key Features:
● Keyword-based intent recognition
● Dynamic responses using dictionaries
● Modular function design
● Expandable to API-based real AI

Future Scope:
Integration with NLP APIs, Text-to-Speech, and Voice Recognition for full AI
assistant behavior.

Showcase in Resume / LinkedIn / Portfolio
AI Study Buddy – Rule-Based Chat Assistant
Designed a smart chatbot using Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals,
and dictionaries). Implemented a keyword-matching logic to make it
behave like a real AI assistant and built modular functions for reusability.
(Future Plan: connect to OpenAI API for real AI responses.)

Practice Tasks
1. Add at least 3 new questions and responses to the chatbot.
2. Add logic to respond differently if the user says “sad” or “happy.”
3. Add a delay (1 second) between question and answer using
time.sleep().
