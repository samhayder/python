🧾 Mini Project – Expense Tracker

Question / Problem Statement: Create a console-based Expense Tracker
program in Python that allows the user to record daily expenses and view
summaries like total spending. Use only the concepts learned till Chapter 6
(loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, and basic input/output).

Project Details / Description:
You are required to build a simple personal finance management tool.
The program should allow the user to:
● Add an expense with details like date, category, description, and amount.
● View all recorded expenses in a clean format.
● Calculate total spending so far.
● Exit the program gracefully when the user chooses to.

All tasks must be implemented using loops, if-else, lists, and dictionaries
only. No user-defined functions or file handling should be used.
